The ratio of PPP conversion factor to market exchange rate is the result obtained by dividing the PPP conversion factor by the market exchange rate. The ratio, also referred to as the national price level, makes it possible to compare the cost of the bundle of goods that make up gross domestic product (GDP) across countries. It tells how many dollars are needed to buy a dollar's worth of goods in the country as compared to the United States. PPP conversion factors are based on the 2011 ICP round.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSourceWorld Bank, International Comparison Program database.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGDP per-capita - PPP int-$ adjusted (2015 current prices):\r\n\"GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current international dollars based on the 2011 ICP round.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSourceWorld Bank, International Comparison Program database.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGDP per-capita - US $ market exchange (2015 current prices):\r\n\"GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population.
