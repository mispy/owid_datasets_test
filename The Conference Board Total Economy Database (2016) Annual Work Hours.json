Even individual countries often provide differing estimates, which are variously based on labor force surveys or establishment surveys. An advantage of estimates based on labor force surveys is that they are usually quite comprehensive. These estimates include adjustments for overtime, sickness, etc.\r\nA disadvantage, however, is that often they slightly overestimate actual hours worked. Figures based on establishment surveys usually only cover hours paid (which may include overtime), and require further adjustments to account for various types of absence.\"\r\n<br>\r\nThe source furthermore  explains that \"the measure used in TED is hours actually worked, so it includes paid overtime and excludes paid hours that are not worked due to sickness, vacation and holidays, etc.\"\r\n</div></body></html>\n",
