This index was calculated by dividing population values in any given year by population in 1961. 1961 = 100. Values >100 indicate an increase in population vs. 1961, and values <100 indicate a decrease.\n</p>\nThe original dataset from WDI used in this calculation was \"Population, total\", which is defined by the World Bank/UN as:\n\"Total population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship. The values shown are midyear estimates.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nData available at: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators [accessed 19th July 2017]\n</div>\n",
