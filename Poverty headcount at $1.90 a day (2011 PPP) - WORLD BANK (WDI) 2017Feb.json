As a result of revisions in PPP exchange rates, poverty rates for individual countries cannot be compared with poverty rates reported in earlier editions.\r\n\r\nTime span: \t1981-2013\r\nGeographic coverage :\tGlobal by country and by world region\r\n\r\nLink:\thttp://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY\r\n\r\nRetrieved: \tDecember 2015\r\n\r\nAdditional information\r\n&#65279;The source notes: \"five countries -- Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Jordan, and Lao PDR -- use the 2005 PPP conversion factors and corresponding $1.25 a day and $2 a day poverty lines. This is due to the large deviations in the rate of change in PPP factors relative to the rate of change in domestic consumer price indexes.
