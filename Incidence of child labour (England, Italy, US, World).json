ILO, 2013.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Incidence of child labour in datasets for England and Italy is based on the percentage of children (aged 10-14) recorded as working at least one hour of work per week (thus defined as \"children in employment\"). Data for the United States is inclusive of 15-year-olds (10-15 years). Figures for the US have been calculated as the weighted-average of gender-specific incidences of labour, based on the male:female ratio (10-14 year-olds) from historical census data.\r\n</p>\r\n<p> Data for the global level is based on the definition of full-time child labour (which excludes children participating in light part-time work). World ILO-EPEAP data from 1950-1995 is based on children aged 10-14. World ILO-IPEC data from 2000-2012 broadens this definition to those aged 5-17. Estimates are based on census and national survey data.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>References:\r\n</p>\r\n<p> Cunningham, H. and Viazzo, P.P.
