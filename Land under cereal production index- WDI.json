This index was calculated by dividing land used for cereals (which is measured in hectares) in any given year by land use in 1961. 1961 = 100. Values >100 indicate an increase in land use vs. 1961, and values <100 indicate a decrease.\r\n</p>\r\nThe original dataset from WDI used in this calculation was \"Land under cereal production (hectares)\", which is defined by the World Bank/FAO as:\r\n\"Land under cereal production refers to harvested area, although some countries report only sown or cultivated area. Cereals include wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, and mixed grains. Production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed, or silage and those used for grazing are excluded.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nData available at: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators [accessed 18th July 2017]\r\n</div>\r\n",
