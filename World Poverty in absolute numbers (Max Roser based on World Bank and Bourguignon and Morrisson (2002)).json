To have one continuous series from 1820 up to 2015 I have followed the idea of Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) to calibrate so that poverty headcounts in \"coincide roughly\" with estimates from the World Bank. Therefore the series is poverty headcount (1.90$ per day) as far back as possible (1981) from the World Bank and all observations before 1980 are Bourguignon and Morrison (2002) 'share of the world population living in extreme poverty'.\r\n\r\n</p></td></tr></span><tr><td>Retrieved</td><td>May 23, 2016</td></tr></table><div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Additional information</h4>\r\n\r\nPeople are considered to live in\u00a0extreme poverty at a consumption (or income) level below 1.90 international-$ per day.
