In turn, these are measured with respect to two different 'poverty lines': (a) 1.90$ a day and (b) 3.10$ a day. Poverty headcount ratio is a proxy for the 'quantity of poverty', while poverty gap represents the 'intensity of poverty'. A more detailed definition of these two variables is available <a href=\"../extreme-poverty/#key-definitions\">here</a>. (<a href=\"../extreme-poverty/#key-definitions\">https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/#key-definitions</a>).</p>\r\n<p> Consumption per capita is the preferred welfare indicator for the World Bank\u2019s analysis of global poverty. But not all national statistical agencies report to the World Bank consistent estimates of consumption based on expenditure surveys. For about 25% of the countries, estimates correspond to income, rather than consumption.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p> As a result of revisions in PPP exchange rates, poverty rates for individual countries cannot be compared with poverty rates reported in earlier editions.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><strong>Data and Methodology.</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/home.aspx\">World Bank</a>'s definition: \"PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that allows you to replicate the calculations made by the World Bank's researchers in estimating the extent of absolute poverty in the world\".</p>\r\n<p>Data are based on primary household survey data obtained from government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments. Data for high-income economies are from the Luxembourg Income Study database.
