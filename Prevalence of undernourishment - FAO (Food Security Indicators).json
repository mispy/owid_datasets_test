The indicator is computed by comparing a probability distribution of habitual daily dietary energy consumption with a threshold level called the minimum dietary energy Requirement. Both are based on the notion of an average individual in the reference population. \u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the traditional FAO hunger indicator, adopted as official Millennium Development Goal indicator for Goal 1, Target 1.9.</p>\n<p>The indicator is calculated in three year averages, from 1990-92 to 2014-16 at regional and national levels, to reduce the impact of possible errors in estimated DES, due to the difficulties in properly accounting of stock variations in major food.</p>\n<p>All the countries and regions as reported by the Millenniumn Development Goals (MDG) regional classification.</p>\n<p>The aggregates are computed using a weighted population average.</p>\n<p>More details on the methodology for computing the prevalence of undernourishment are in \"Annex 2\" of the \"State of Food Insecurity in the World 2015\" Report (http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/).</p>\n\n</div></body></html>\n",
