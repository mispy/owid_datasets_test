Significant variability between individual lifestyles in the UK, and across comparable high-income countries is to be expected. This breakdown does not include estimates of per capita contribution to national services, manufacturing and infrastructure; Goodall estimated this additional component to comprise approximately 35% of an individual's footprint. \r\n</p>\r\n</div>",
